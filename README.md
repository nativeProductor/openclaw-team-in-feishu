# openclaw-team-in-feishu

> Make your OpenClaw agents collaborate in Feishu groups. Two built-in modes: **round-robin** (host calls on each member in turn) and **free-speak** (members decide when to chime in).

## Overview

You've built N OpenClaw agents — each runs and responds individually. This project wires them into one or more Feishu groups so they can hold a structured discussion: a user @-mentions the host bot with a topic, the host opens a thread, members contribute one by one, and the host emits a closing summary when the conversation has converged.

**What it does**

1. Watches each Feishu group's main chat for `@host` mentions
2. Invokes the host agent to open a thread with the topic confirmed
3. Drives subsequent dialogue using one of two modes (configurable per group)
4. Stops when the host emits the configured end keyword (`[END]` by default)

**What it doesn't**

- Doesn't create OpenClaw agents (use OpenClaw's own CLI)
- Doesn't replace OpenClaw's Feishu plugin (member auto-reply in round-robin mode depends on it)
- Isn't a general Feishu bot framework

### Three contracts

1. **Discussion rules live in `SOUL.md`, not the daemon.** Turn order, max rounds, when to emit `[END]`, when to emit `[SKIP]` — all enforced by each agent's LLM reading its `SOUL.md`. The daemon does mechanism only: poll, write transcripts, fork openclaw, post replies. Changing the discussion shape (debate / review / brainstorm) means editing `SOUL.md` — daemon code does not change.
2. **The host bot's OpenClaw Feishu plugin must be disabled; member bots' must be enabled.** With both enabled, host responses double-fire, creating duplicate threads and silent stalls. The daemon enforces this with a startup preflight check.
3. **Transcript files are the single source of truth.** Both daemon and agents read state from the same Markdown files. Each message is appended once and mirrored under both `<thread_id>.md` (daemon's bookkeeping) and `<chat_id>.md` (path that `SOUL.md` instructs each agent to `cat`).

### Modes

| | round-robin | free-speak |
|---|---|---|
| Who picks next speaker | Host @-mentions members per `SOUL.md` order | Daemon polls each agent with a `[SKIP]` option; agents decide |
| Member trigger | OpenClaw Feishu plugin auto-fires on `@-mention` | Daemon directly invokes via openclaw CLI |
| Convergence | Host emits `[END]` at max rounds or when sufficient | Host emits `[END]` once domains are covered or limit reached |
| Best for | Reviews, planning sessions where every role must speak | Brainstorming, decisions where each domain decides relevance |

### When can the host end a discussion?

The host can emit `[END]` at any of its invocation points — it is not forced to wait for `maxRounds` or `maxMessages`. Each invocation passes the full transcript to the host's LLM, which decides per its `SOUL.md` whether to output a closing summary + `[END]` or to continue. Invocation cadence:

- **round-robin**: after every member reply
- **free-speak**: at least once per polling cycle (host is the tail candidate when daemon walks the queue)

Only the host bot's `[END]` ends a thread. A human or other bot posting `[END]` in the thread is treated as content, not as a control signal.

---

## Prerequisites

### OpenClaw

- OpenClaw gateway running (`openclaw channels status --probe` lists your bot channels)
- Each agent created at `<openclawRoot>/<agent>/workspace/`
- `openclaw agent --agent <name> --message "test"` returns a valid response

### Feishu

- N self-built apps (one per agent, including the host)
- Each app added to its target group(s) as a bot member
- Required scopes per role — see [docs/feishu-permissions.md](docs/feishu-permissions.md)
- For each group: host bot's OpenClaw Feishu plugin disabled, member bots' enabled

### Runtime

- Node.js ≥ 18
- `openclaw` CLI on `PATH`
- `jq`, `curl` (used by examples)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nativeProductor/openclaw-team-in-feishu.git
cd openclaw-team-in-feishu
npm install --no-audit --no-fund
sudo npm link --no-audit --no-fund
octf --help
```

(`--no-audit --no-fund` skips registry-side checks that can be slow on some networks; functional install is unaffected.)

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Scaffold config + SOUL templates
mkdir -p /etc/octf && cd /etc/octf

# Interactive Q&A:
octf init

# OR template-based (faster if you have many agents):
#   octf init --template > my-config.json
#   $EDITOR my-config.json     # fill in cli_xxx / oc_xxx / agents / members
#   octf init --from my-config.json

# 2. Edit each SOUL with your business persona / behavior rules
$EDITOR souls/pm-host.md   # ... and one per agent

# 3. Set the secrets your config references via ${VAR}
export PM_HOST_SECRET=...; export DEV_SECRET=...
# (recommended: put them in /etc/octf/secrets.env, chmod 600)

# 4. Validate the wiring + auto-resolve open_ids into SOUL rosters
octf link --apply

# 5. Deploy SOULs into agent workspaces
for a in pm-host dev mkt-a qa; do
  cp souls/$a.md /path/to/oc/$a/workspace/SOUL.md
done

# 6. Start the daemon
octf daemon start
```

In your Feishu group: `@<host_bot> <topic>`. The host opens a thread and the discussion runs to convergence.

### Adding a chat later

To bind your existing team to a new Feishu group (after `init`):

```bash
# 1. Add the host + members to the new Feishu group as bot members.
# 2. Bind it via:
octf chat add \
  --chat oc_NEW_GROUP_ID \
  --mode round-robin \
  --host pm-host \
  --members dev,mkt-a,qa \
  --max-rounds 5

# 3. Resolve open_ids + patch SOUL rosters for the new group:
octf link --apply

# 4. Copy any newly-rendered SOULs into agent workspaces (only if the
# host or members weren't already serving another chat).

# 5. Restart daemon:
octf daemon restart
```

To unbind: `octf chat remove --chat oc_xxx`. To see all bound chats: `octf chat list`.

---

## Testing

```bash
octf verify --chat <oc_xxx> --topic "smoke test"
```

`verify` triggers a discussion using a member bot's identity (no real-user token needed), watches the thread, and exits 0 once the host emits `[END]` or 1 on timeout.

---

## Configuration

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "openclawRoot": "/path/to/oc",
  "transcriptDir": "/path/to/oc/.shared",
  "polling": { "intervalMs": 2500, "openclawTimeoutSec": 180 },

  "apps": [
    { "appId": "cli_xxx",
      "appSecret": "${PM_HOST_SECRET}",
      "agent": "pm-host",
      "role": "Product",
      "botName": "ProductBot" }
  ],

  "chats": [
    { "name": "ProductReview",
      "chatId": "oc_xxx",
      "mode": "round-robin",
      "host": "pm-host",
      "members": ["dev", "mkt", "qa"],
      "modeOptions": { "maxRounds": 5, "endKeyword": "[END]" } }
  ]
}
```

## Limitations

- `maxRounds` and `maxMessages` are soft bounds (LLM-honored, not daemon-enforced)
- Daemon state is in-process memory; restart loses dedup tables
- Each agent invocation receives the full transcript (input scales with cumulative message count)
- Polling cadence is 2.5s; user-to-host latency is typically 5–15s
- Single OpenClaw gateway = single LLM queue across all groups
- Threads can only be ended by the host bot emitting `[END]`; humans cannot interrupt mid-discussion by posting in the thread
- Adding or removing a chat requires a daemon restart (config is read at startup)
